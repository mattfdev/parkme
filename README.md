Park.me MEAN stack Web application

Park.me is an interactive, easy to use, real-time web application that allows users to find or post private parking spots from
any device they have on hand. The development team was inspired by the popular home rental service called AirBnB, specifically
the serviceâ€™s excellent user interface, extensive use of visual information on a map, and communal sharing culture. The web application
is built from the ground up using the MEAN stack.

The Web application was built for the CPS630 course's final project. 4 Developers were involved in the project,
I specifically built the mapping portion of the front end, and portions of the Angular backend, specifically the routing logic,
Google Maps functionality, and half the database querying logic
